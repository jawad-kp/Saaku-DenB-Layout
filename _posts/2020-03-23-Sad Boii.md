You go back to sleep hoping for a nightmare,<br>
The calm relief of terror washing over an unending void.<br>
Consciousness is a agitating<br>
And you don’t like agitation<br>
But how long can you sleep for?<br>
<br><br>
How long until<br>
The void fills out and you feel nothing.<br>
The walls are closing in; crowding around you,<br>
But you feel numb<br>
You can tell the walls are closer now<br>
The dark feels even darker<br>
The sadness more melancholic<br>
Being awake is a new kind of pain<br>
Like stubbing a toe <br>
But just the discomfort with none of the feeling<br>

So you give up and give in<br>
Go back to sleep<br>
Hoping to feel something<br>
Anything at all<br>
Anything<br>
<br>
The nightmare welcomes you,<br>
You embrace it<br>
It’s the only way you feel.<br>
It’s all that remains real.<br>
The chaos brings out a calm<br>
A calm that strikes fear in your core but a calm nevertheless<br>
<br>
Soon the nightmare is all there is<br>
The panic and fear is all there is<br>
But you don’t mind it<br>
It’s the only way you feel now<br>
It’s all you have now<br>
<br>
So you go back to sleep <br>
Hoping for a nightmare<br>
Hoping to feel all that you can’t<br>
Hoping you don’t wake up<br>
Hoping for death<br>
<br>
