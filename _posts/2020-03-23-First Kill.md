<p>As we near the bungalow, my palms get sweaty and the gun in my pocket starts feeling heavy. Is it time to take it out?? <br>
I glance at my partner who I am an apprentice of sorts to. He sways his head in a sign clearly meant to say &ldquo;No&#8230; Too Soon&rdquo;.<br>
I try again to focus on the task at hand and run the plan through in my head, it was simple. Break into the house&#8230;. Locate the target&#8230;.. Bam!!! &#8230;..Simple. At least that&rsquo;s what I kept telling myself.<br>
After breaking past the main security systems, we reach the door. My partner hacks into the inner security as I cover for him. My hands are trembling with fear and a tinge of excitement.<br>
I keep telling myself, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this&#8230;&#8230;No worries&#8230;.You can do this&#8230;Just calm down&rdquo;<br>
Just then I begin doubting myself all over again. My partner signals me to move in, gun in hand.<br>
We find the poor man sleeping peacefully, probably dreaming about the booming hitman business and how he was going to be at the centre of it.<br>
My partner points a finger at the sleeping man and runs his finger along the smooth line on his neck. It means only one thing. Kill Him.<br>
I was to have my vengeance&#8230;.The man who killed my husband was now going to die by my hands or at least my gun. I take a deep breath in and point the gun at him.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t shoot.<br>
I just don&rsquo;t get myself to pull the trigger&#8230;.<br>
Why was I hesitant?? That man deserved to die for killing the many people he did for something as vile as&#8230;money!!<br>
Was I feeling guilty?? Ending someone&rsquo;s life, watching them draw their final breath and more importantly being the reason they draw their final breath at that moment&#8230;. Was this my conscience kicking in telling me &lsquo;this is Wrong&#8230;Vengeance solves nothing&rsquo;</p>

<p>No&#8230;I was past that point. <br>
Only people with something worth living for have a conscience, only people who care about how someone looks at them and whether or not they deserved being looked at that way have a conscience.<br>
People with nothing to lose&#8230;People with nothing worth living for, feel no emotion of that sort&#8230;.At least&#8230;.. I didn&rsquo;t.<br>
Conscience left my soul the day the love of my life&#8230;.my Husband was murdered in cold-blood, on a hit the man sleeping in front me ordered. <br>
 My mind is beyond depraved human emotions like guilt and pity in the middle of a job. I was smarter than that. I didn&rsquo;t shoot because I notice something.<br>
 I had a witness.<br>
An armed, trained man, watching me take my shot, the time I am most vulnerable. I work out all the possible scenarios and choose the best one.<br>
I point the gun at my partner&#8230;. The witness. He turns with a stunned look on his face only to be met with a metal bullet. My lips mouthing &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; on a face that clearly isn&rsquo;t, is the last thing he sees before dropping to the floor with a hole between his eyes. He falls face front on the floor and is now in a puddle of blood&#8230;.His blood. No witness. My partner had wiped the cameras clear. He was to regain his position in the Corporation after the death of this man. Now his dream lay in a pool of blood, carrying it away from him. <br>
A real-life silencer is nothing like that in the movies it stuns the sound just enough for anyone not too close to not hear it.<br>
I head into the room as the man is rudely woken up by the silenced shot. I walk into the room and place the open end of the hot barrel of my gun right between his eyes. I can hear the sizzling of his skin as man becomes wide awake and realises what is happening. I say, &ldquo;Remember me??...No?? I am Arza&#8230;the actual target of the hit that went very wrong&#8230;so wrong that it&rsquo;s the reason you&rsquo;re going to die like this&#8230;.&rdquo; And just as he realises who I am and his eyes widen more than they already were, I Pull the trigger.<br>
