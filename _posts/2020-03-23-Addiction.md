 “Take it or leave it”, the scrawny looking man told me. I stood there contemplating whether I was that desperate or not. Conflicting thoughts poured down into my seemingly large head in a heated battle of wits with each other claiming how one is far more superior to the other... Or so it seemed to me.
Did I need it? Was I that unsettled and sleepless over something as pointless as that. Maybe I was or maybe I was just very lonely.
The weird high I got on its consumption...The sense of satisfaction and calm... The way all signs of hunger for it disappeared just by its intoxicating aroma. Of course, the man trying to sell it to me was oblivious to this heated debate in my head.
“I can’t lower the price any further… that’s the lowest I can afford to go and this is the last one mind you... It’s become very rare with the government ban getting serious and stuff.....”
<br><br>
BAN... The shortest word in the world that makes people rebel against something by just being there. It’s funny how the human mind works...We don’t give a damn about something until we are told it’s off-limits and forbidden. It made me think... Would Adam and Eve eat that apple if God didn’t tell them anything about not eating it?? There were more interesting things there...Who’d give that much thought about eating a tiny apple hanging from a tree...
I can’t help but wonder if this is just me trying to rebel against something I am clearly asked not to do...Or was it simply Desperation arising out of intense addiction and unexplained hunger. The latter made me feel bad about my self-control abilities... Could it be true?? Was I addicted??
“Please Hurry up Sir!!” The man said kicking me out of my deep, made up, philosophical, extremely intellectually, thought-provoking, universe.
I looked at him and saw the desperation of a different kind one that’s fuelled by the desire of getting rid of something that would affect one’s societal trust rankings and undermine any future venture one would attempt to venture for the time the memory of this exchange existed in people’s mind. If it ever got out that is...<br>
I look at him and say what he’s waiting for me to say for so long,<br>
<br>“I’ll Take It”<br>
“Good to know!!”<br>
He says sarcastically but relieved as he sells it to me.
I walk home with a weird sense of accomplishment of being the owner of the last packet there was. The last available packet of Maggi.
