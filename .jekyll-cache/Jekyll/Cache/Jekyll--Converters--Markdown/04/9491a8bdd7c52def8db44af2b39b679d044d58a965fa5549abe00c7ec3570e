I".<p>“Why is the meat burnt??” an angry husky voice shouted out loud. 
Priya dressed in her green skirt, teddy in one hand, takes slow steps to the kitchen. She peeps in through the side trying to make sense of what’s going on.
A plate shatters, she looks on scared, at the broken pieces of glass on the floor. She hears a shout and gulping sounds and walks in the kitchen. 
It’s her father, drunk, full of rage holding her mother by the neck as she struggles to free herself.
“Mom!!” she cries out. Her father turns looks at her full of hate his black eyes full of blood. He lets her mother go. Her mother slumps to the floor struggling to breathe. He walks on to her a knife in his hand…..
He gives a loud shout, Priya looks on in fear unsure of what to do, leave her mother alone and save herself or die at the hand of the creature who was supposed to be her father. Her father raises his hand high, she drops her teddy and covers her face,
She shouts in fear, her father shouts in his drunk state, “Aargh!!!”……..</p>

<p>She wakes up panting… Her long tangled hair and face sticky being covered in sweat. Her eyes are wide open, she is more awake now than she ever was before. She stares at the scar on her hand faded now…twenty years after that horrific tale.</p>

<p>A lot had changed in that time, it felt like an eternity since it happened but the memory of that day is as vivid as it was the day it happened. She couldn’t be put off by it now, she told herself. She had a big day ahead, she was going to meet her dad.</p>

<p>Her foster parents had a good deal of religious ethic embedded in them and did their best possible.
She pretended to take in all of. It was the best she could do. She stood now thinking of how she trained herself to face this day should it ever come and what she’d tell her dead, but her notes never went beyond ‘Fuck You’.</p>

<p>She was trained in martial arts, toughened up to face the worst possible form of torture and in all of that emotional confrontation never showed up. She was clueless about what she had to do clueless for the first time in years.</p>

<p>She walks up to the mini bar of her hotel room, picks up a cold beer and walks straight into the balcony. She brushes her hair moving her fingers along every inch of it and stands taking in what’s left of the night. She begins to play that night in her head all over again……</p>

<p>A scared Priya stood there, not knowing what to do.
“You escaped the first one but the 2nd one is not far along….” her father says, approaching her, bloodshot eyes looking deep into her. He raises the knife. Priya’s eyes widen open unable to understand what’s happening….why it was happening. She could only look on.</p>

<p>A glass slams into her father’s hand, he drops his knife and turns around and her mother is up. 
“Leave her out of this. She’s your daughter, isn’t she??” She asks with tear filled eyes and in a completely broken voice.</p>

<p>“Yeah sure, maybe I will…” He says sarcastically. He looks at Priya, a deep threatening gaze.</p>

<p>The next moment he slams her head into a wall. Priya is knocked out cold.</p>

<p>The next thing she knows she was in a hospital, being treated after the most horrific experience she ever had. After a few days, she is told nine catastrophic words by the officer in charge that change who she becomes, nine words that she would never forget, nine words she hopes no one ever has to hear.</p>

<p>“I am Sorry, but…..your mother is um….no more….”</p>

<p>She gulps down the last of her beer hoping it would be enough to make her forget it. It doesn’t.</p>

<p>She wakes up the next morning, puts on a black coat and a scarf around her head. Her trademark Ray Ban’s covering her eyes, she picks up a violin case and walks out, looking like an Egyptian goddess, evident from the stares she gets as she steps into her taxi.</p>

<p>“Rakham Street” she tells the driver as she sits in the back seat of her 
She gets off a block before and walks on ahead. Taking precautions to make sure no one is following her.
She looks around one last time to make sure no one has noticed her, the place was deserted, just the way she liked it. She walks up the stairs wondering what she could’ve become if that night never happened…A Vet? She definitely liked animals or an Orthodontist? She wonders as she looks at the sign hanging above her…. nope, not an orthodontist ….she couldn’t handle bad breath.</p>

<p>She walks into a dingy room with the lights fluctuating between extremely happy and under depressed and finally dead. The power was out. This was going to be a long wait.</p>

<p>She sits on a stool looking at the world outside sly as a fox just as the obnoxious man enters the cafe in front of her. She prepares herself. The moment has arrived. She begins to set shop. 
She opens up her violin case and brings out her Rottenheimer 68 sniper, sets it up beside a picture of trade routes to the eastern peninsula, man the apartment was old, this guy has maps for decoration she thinks to herself and takes aim. For a slight moment she debates the ethics of what she is doing, is it right?? Is it wrong?? She didn’t care. So she moves on.</p>

<p>She looks into her scope adjusting it just enough to fit the man clearly in her view. She takes a deep breath, an endeavour to calm herself. She fixes her aim and looks right at her target. She whispers, “Bub-bye Moron” and shoots. The bullet shatters the glass and gets lodged deep in the skull. The man’s head smack the cake he ordered face first, blood drips from the side of his head forming a thin stream and flows down meeting the white table cloth. The waitress gives a loud shriek and drops her tray.</p>

<p>Priya smiles. A perfect hit. She gets up packs her gun and puts up her signature a tiny plastic skull holding a message in its mouth. A message that read, “Dark Fury was here…”</p>

<p>She packs her gloves and gun and walks out like nothing happened. Her training at the hands of RAW paid off.</p>

<p>Checks out of her hotel and leaves for the airport.
 Her father would be next.</p>
