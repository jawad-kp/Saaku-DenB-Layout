<h1>Smoking kills</h1>

	<h4>Beads of Sweat took crescent shapes as they crawled down Karan&rsquo;s forehead and across the mild pubescent acne down his cheeks. He moved his hand across his forehead in a bid to wipe the mixture of sweat and oil that had now accumulated in a thin veil. He wipes his hands on his cheap T-Shirt which gets a tinge brown shade in the shape of Sri Lanka.</h4>
<h4>He needed his palms to be dry. He needed them to grip the wooden bat hard. His throat is parched and slightly itchy but he had no time for frivolities like drinking water at this stage. He couldn&rsquo;t abandon this opportunity that lay ahead of him for something like water. He was going to have to fight through it.</h4>
<h4>He twirls the bat in the air and grabs the handle just as it descends elegantly spinning like a ballet dancer. A move aimed at calming nerves. It all came down to this&hellip;this very last ball. It was a matter of respect now and no longer just a sport.</h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>300 seconds ago</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h4>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget about this match and start afresh!&rdquo; the rival team from the 66<sup>th</sup> cross&rsquo;s captain yells.</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;You need seven runs in two balls and you&rsquo;re down to the new guy and Raghu, just give this one to us and let&rsquo;s toss for the next one&rdquo; he says addressing the 65<sup>th</sup> cross&rsquo;s captain.</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;No!! C&rsquo;mon&hellip; You said it&rsquo;s the *last* two balls. We can win this!&rdquo; shouts Karan.</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;Nobody asked you, new guy!! We&rsquo;re playing you just as a courtesy so why don&rsquo;t you just&hellip;&rdquo;</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;You know what?? If you&rsquo;re this confident we&rsquo;ll play. If we lose though&hellip;it&rsquo;s on you&hellip; and you know what that means, we *never* play you. Ever. You still wanna play these last two balls??&rdquo; says the 65<sup>th</sup> cross team&rsquo;s captain cutting off what was going to be a barrage of expletives coming off like a stream of bullets from an Automatic machine gun.</h4>
<h4>Karan nods a yes. He couldn&rsquo;t refuse, not because he didn&rsquo;t want to but simply because he would lose any chances of building a reputation. It&rsquo;s hard bouncing back once you become a &lsquo;sissy&rsquo; who refused a challenge. Although &lsquo;sissy&rsquo; is not the exact term they&rsquo;d use.</h4>
<h4>Respect&hellip; Reputation its weird isn&rsquo;t it?? How we strive for each from the moment we understand how societal dynamics work.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;To feel accepted. To feel a part of a bigger group. We strive for individual attention but always seek out acceptance into a group. It makes one wonder how did this collective society where an individual is made to think according to what a bunch of strangers whose names will probably remain a mystery, who will come to judge you, time after time, exponentially change how an individual functions. When a &lsquo;weird&rsquo; becomes established.</h4>
<h4>Our protagonist, however, wasn&rsquo;t thinking about social dynamics like our narrator. He just had to make sure that this doesn&rsquo;t become the last game he gets to play in this unknown town.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;Really?? We&rsquo;re at this stage because *you* wasted six balls!! You sure we&hellip;and by &lsquo;we&rsquo; I mean &lsquo;you&rsquo;&hellip; can pull off seven in two??&rdquo; asks the 65<sup>th</sup> cross team captain.</h4>
<h4>Karan mumbles a low &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;.</h4>
<h4>A &lsquo;sure&rsquo; he would come to regret.</h4>
<h4>Somewhere along a Highway at the same time</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;You Just gotta igniiiiite&hellip;.the liiight&hellip;..and leeeet it shiiine&rdquo; a raspy and unusually delighted manly voice fills the void in the spunky sedan.</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;Just oowwwn the niiight like the fourrrrth of juuuly!!!!&rdquo; a melodious voice from the radio chimes back.</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;Cause baby you&rsquo;re a Fiiiirework!!!!! Come And show em Whaaaat You&rsquo;re worth!!! Make em go Ah Ah Ah as you shoot across the skyyy eye eyeee!!!&rdquo; both harmonize in the most weird and painful melody to ever be created in the history of painful melodies</h4>
<h4>Neither voice seemingly cared. One source wasn&rsquo;t physically present and the other was too busy bursting his colours and being a firework.</h4>
<h4>He pulls down his window and taps gently on the cigarette he&rsquo;s holding onto. The ash drips down and briefly travels at 100 kilometres per hour before the resistance finally causes it to cascade in a file down on to the hot tarred road.</h4>
<h4>Our driver pulls down the passenger side window so the smoke doesn&rsquo;t all get sucked out through his side.</h4>
<h4>This was going to be his last cigarette he swore to himself. He had planned on quitting after this pack was done. Something about his colleague/smoking partner dying of cancer made him take this step.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;His colleague hadn&rsquo;t died of lung cancer and our Katy Perry loving driver was fully aware but something about the finality of death made him rethink his &lsquo;YOLO&rsquo; attitude.</h4>
<h4>He swore to himself at his smoking buddy&rsquo;s funeral that he wasn&rsquo;t going to let a cluster of overgrown cancerous cells take over and end his life. It also gave him immense perspective on why his smoking buddy yelled &ldquo;You Only Ever Live ONCE sons of respectable women!!&rdquo; from the terrace at the unaware bunch of strangers walking down the street on being told chain-smoking isn&rsquo;t a particularly good habit. Though &lsquo;Respectable women&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t the exact term he used.</h4>
<h4>In the centre pitch of what the local government claimed was a ground but also doubled down as a garbage dump for the locals</h4>
<h4>&lsquo;Okay&hellip;buddy&hellip; all you need to do is score just the one run and the other six is on Raghu and they can&rsquo;t really blame you for that right?? You could work with that&hellip; Probably&hellip;&rsquo; Karan thought to himself. Worst case scenario would be that he gets picked last. Picked last, he could work his way through the team hierarchy after that. Picked last was better than not being picked at all.</h4>
<h4>As he took the crease his mind was focused on a single thing. Score that one run. One tiny little run.</h4>
<h4>The Bowler walks back a few yards in preparation for his run-up to the crease. The bowler was a skinny, five foot three, slightly dusky dude who bowled a lowly excuse for medium fast bowling.</h4>
<h4>Tension and pressure, however, create a totally different image in the mind of our protagonist.</h4>
<h4>He saw a six foot tall, heavily built, West Indian bowler approaching him like a lion about to pounce on its unsuspecting prey. Karan gulps. This was going to be bad. He breathes out slowly trying to calm himself. One run buddy. Just get this one run.</h4>
<h4>He just had to angle the ball to a different place and make a run for the other end of the pitch. Simple enough, except it wasn&rsquo;t, not with a six-foot tall giant running at a five foot five kid.</h4>
<h4>The giant begins his run-up looking scarier moving than he was standing and staring down. His run-up ends as quickly as it begins. Karan just aims the bat straight, angled low towards the ground in a bid to play the ball straight down the line.</h4>
<h4>As soon as he feels the ball hit his bat he makes a run for it. He swings his bat across his torso like a pendulum and pulls forward like he never had before. He reaches the other end of the crease but just as he turns he sees Raghu running back at him yelling &ldquo;Woo&rdquo;??... No, he meant two!!! Karan dashes back to the other end of the pitch just as fast as he runs away from it. &lsquo;Shit&hellip;&rsquo; Karan thinks to himself. They now needed five runs from one ball and it was Karan who&rsquo;d be facing the last ball.</h4>
<h4>The only way to pull this off would be to score a six. This involved hitting the ball out of the park, a feat incredibly hard for a player who tired out running the two runs he had.</h4>
<h4>&lsquo;Now&hellip; Or Never&rsquo; Karan thinks to himself. He closes his eyes and prepares himself for this moment. This was real (well&hellip;as real as a fictional story written by a guy in his pyjamas could be).</h4>
<h4>The giant after setting the field to his satisfaction begins his run-up.</h4>
<h4>Karan drives confidence from the fact that he scored two runs and now stares down equally hard at the giant bowling to him.</h4>
<h4>In the run-up the giant grew smaller and smaller with each step he took until he reached the crease and finally turned into the same scrawny kid.</h4>
<h4>Karan taps the ground with his bat hard and finally with all his strength slams the ball down the left side of the field over the buildings. He hit a six. He won the game. He wouldn&rsquo;t be picked last next time. He breathes a sigh of extreme relief.</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;If we loose this ball, you&rsquo;re paying for the new one&rdquo; the 65<sup>th</sup> Cross&rsquo;s team captain says.</h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>Somewhere Mid-Air</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h4>A green round furry sphere rising over buildings slowly, pondered over its existential crisis. As it descended sped up by gravity it wondered why humans ever created this specimen which they throw and then a member of the same species simply runs behind chasing this very same specimen that was thrown away. Was it loved or despised??</h4>
<h4>And why did each half have mixed feelings about it as time varied. It decided to simply obey the law and came crashing down aided by Mr Gravity who for reasons beyond it wanted this ball to be stuck to the ground&hellip;24X7. Like&hellip; take a break dude.</h4>
<h4>Our Katy Perry loving driver was unaware of this spheroid heading towards him or its existential crisis. Mostly because the spheroid was a non-living creature but for some reason assumed by the narrator to be a worthy character in this exaggerated story.</h4>
<h4>The Spheroid hits the driver on his head entering the over-speeding automobile from the passenger window. The impact wasn&rsquo;t huge although the collision with the truck after our driver swerves off his lane was.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;Listening to firework, our Katy Perry loving driver turned into one himself. Well at the very least he had, had his last puff by then. Smoking did indeed kill.</h4>
